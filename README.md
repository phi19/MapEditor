# MapEditor

## Project Description
A VERY simplified paint made with Simple Graphics Library from <Academia de CÃ³digo_>, after 4 weeks of learning Java.

## Instructions
You start with a auto-generated grid with as many squares as you want by side (be careful: too many squares can overload the program). You can also choose if it shows limits.
Then, a green square appears in the upper left corner. That's you! (no offense).

## Controls
**ARROW KEYS** : *Move the green square*  
**SPACE** : *Paint/Erase the square you're on*  
**[0-9]** : *Choose color* (check the color guide on the resources folder)  
**B** : *Switch to erase mode*  
**C** : *Clear your screen*  
**S** : *Save your current screen*  
**L** : *Load your last screen*
