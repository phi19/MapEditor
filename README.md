# MapEditor

## Project Description
A bootcamp project after 4 weeks of learning Java.
We were challenged to do a VERY simplified paint in Simple Graphics Library.

## Instructions
You start with a auto-generated grid with as many squares as you want by side (be careful: too many squares can overload the program). You can also choose if it shows limits.
Then, a green square appears in the upper left corner. That's you! (no offense).

Controls:
**ARROW KEYS** : *Move the green square*
**SPACE** : *Paint/Erase the square you're on*
**[0-9]** : *Choose color* (check the color guide on the resources folder)
**B** : *Switch to erase mode*
**C** : *Clear your screen*
**S** : *Save your current screen*
**L** : *Load your last screen*
