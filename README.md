# MapEditor

## Project Description
A VERY simplified "paint" made with Simple Graphics Library from <Academia de CÃ³digo_>, after 4 weeks of learning Java.  

## Instructions
The program starts with a squared grid with as many squares as side length as the user wishes (be careful: too many squares can overload the program).  
The user can also choose to see limits around each square.  
Then, a green square appears in the upper left corner. That's the user! (no offense). 

## Controls
**ARROW KEYS** : *Move the green square*  
**SPACE** : *Paint/Erase the square you're on*  
**[0-9]** : *Choose color* (check the color guide on the resources folder)  
**B** : *Switch to erase mode*  
**C** : *Clear your screen*  
**S** : *Save your current screen*  
**L** : *Load your last screen*
