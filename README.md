# MapEditor

## Project Description
A bootcamp project after 4 weeks of learning Java.
We were challenged to do a VERY simplified paint in Simple Graphics Library.

## Instructions
You start with a auto-generated grid with as many squares as you want by side (be careful: too many squares can overload the program). You can also choose if it shows limits.

Then, a green square appears in the upper left corner. That's you! (no offense). You can *move* this square along the grid using the **keyboard arrows**.

If you press **space** while moving, you *paint* the square you're on. What color, btw? You choose!

You have *10 colors* to choose from, using your **numbered keys** (not numpad).

To know which numbers correspond to which colors, go to the resources folder and see the png guide.

Finally, you can press the **B key** to switch to *erase* mode. Again, press **space** while moving so you can really *erase* the square you're on.
